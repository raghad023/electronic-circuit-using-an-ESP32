## design and program a simple electronic circuit using an ESP32 microcontroller and a sensor

PIR Sensor: Detects motion by sensing infrared radiation (heat) from people or objects. When it detects motion, it sends a signal to the ESP32.

LED: Lights up when the PIR sensor detects motion.

ESP32: Monitors the PIR sensor. If motion is detected, it turns on the LED and prints "Motion detected!" to the serial monitor.
